    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const players2 = players.slice();
    players2['3'] = 'Rayman';
    console.log(players, players2);

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person2.name = 'Bos Wes';
    console.log(person, person2);
    console.clear();

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 30});//But this can only copy till it is single layered
    console.log(person, person3);
    console.clear();
    
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person4 = {... person};
    person4.age = 60;
    console.log(person, person4);
    console.clear();

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
